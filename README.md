## Hi! I’m Lilith Štefánia Bentley.

I’m a web designer and full-stack developer with over a decade of front-end development experience. I have demonstrated skills in semantic HTML5, CSS3, responsive design, ARIA and accesibility, jQuery, Node.js, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, Git, Adobe Creative Suite, and multiple content management systems. I’m a passionate supporter of web standards and best practices, user experience and accessibility, and flat track roller derby.
